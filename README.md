Guess My Number Game!!

The main goal of this game is to achieve the highest score of 20, which can only be attained by guessing the right number on the first try.

At the start of the game, you receive a random whole number between 1 and 20 hidden behind the '?' sign. Your goal is to guess the correct number.

Your score starts at 20 and decreases by one each time you make a wrong guess. If you guess correctly, your score on the scoreboard becomes your highest score. So, essentially, to achieve a good score in the game, you need to guess the right number using fewer chances. If you exceed your number of chances, which is 20, then you automatically lose the game and need to click 'again' to start over.

TIPS:
Use the text shown on the screen ('Wrong Number', 'Too High', 'Too Low') each time you click 'Check' as a guide to guess the right number.
If you guess the right number, the screen changes its color to green, and you receive the text 'Correct Number'. You only get a new high score if it is higher than the previous one.

ENJOY!!
